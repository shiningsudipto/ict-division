      about:
        "Nahid Islam, born in 1998 in Dhaka, is a prominent Bangladeshi student activist and adviser on ICT to the interim government of Bangladesh. He gained national attention as one of the key coordinators of the 2024 Anti-Discrimination Students Movement, which played a significant role in the Bangladesh quota reform movement. This movement eventually escalated into a non-cooperation movement that contributed to the overthrow of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinaâ€™s government, despite initial dismissals of the protesters as Razakar. Currently, Nahid serves under Chief Adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Muhammad Yunus, as part of the interim government formed following these events. A sociology student at the University of Dhaka, Nahid completed his intermediate education at Govt. Science College in Tejgaon. He comes from a humble background, with his father working as a teacher and his mother as a homemaker. Nahid is married and has a younger brother, Nakib, who is also studying at the University of Dhaka.",
